# Go Memory Optimization Examples

This package demonstrates key memory management concepts that many Go developers treat as a "black box". Understanding these concepts can dramatically improve your application's performance.

## The Problem

Most developers:
- Create new structs in tight loops
- Forget escape analysis exists  
- Blame the GC when latency spikes

## What's Really Happening

- **Small, short-lived values** ‚Üí Stack allocation (fast)
- **Escaping or large objects** ‚Üí Heap allocation (slower)
- **Heap allocations** ‚Üí Managed by concurrent GC
- **More heap = more GC cycles = slower performance**

## Examples Included

### 1. Allocation Patterns (`allocation_patterns.go`)
Shows the difference between:
- ‚ùå Bad: Creating pointer structs in loops with dynamic allocations
- ‚úÖ Good: Using value types, fixed arrays, and pre-allocated slices

### 2. Object Pooling (`sync_pool.go`) 
Demonstrates:
- ‚ùå Bad: Creating/destroying expensive objects repeatedly
- ‚úÖ Good: Using `sync.Pool` to reuse objects and reduce GC pressure

### 3. Escape Analysis (`escape_analysis.go`)
Explains when values escape to heap:
- Storing pointers in slices/maps
- Assignment to `interface{}`
- Large structs (>64KB typically)
- Returning pointers to local variables

### 4. GC Monitoring (`gc_monitoring.go`)
Shows how to:
- Monitor GC statistics
- Tune GC behavior with `GOGC`
- Detect memory leaks
- Use profiling tools

## How to Run

### allocation_patterns
cd "c:\Users\Admin\Documents\IT\go-learn\optimization\gc_optimization";
go run allocation_patterns.go

### escape_analysis
cd "c:\Users\Admin\Documents\IT\go-learn\optimization\gc_optimization";
go build -gcflags=-m escape_analysis.go

### sync_pool
cd "c:\Users\Admin\Documents\IT\go-learn\optimization\gc_optimization"; 
go run sync_pool.go

### gc_monitoring
cd "c:\Users\Admin\Documents\IT\go-learn\optimization\gc_optimization";
go run gc_monitoring.go

## Memory Optimization Summary

### Key Concepts Demonstrated:

#### 1. ALLOCATION PATTERNS:
- ‚ùå Creating structs with pointers in loops
- ‚ùå Using fmt.Sprintf and dynamic allocations
- ‚úÖ Pre-allocating slices with known capacity
- ‚úÖ Using value types and fixed-size arrays

#### 2. OBJECT POOLING:
- ‚ùå Creating/destroying objects repeatedly
- ‚úÖ Using sync.Pool for expensive objects
- ‚úÖ Resetting and reusing buffers/structures

#### 3. ESCAPE ANALYSIS:
- ‚Üí **Stack**: Small, short-lived values
- ‚Üí **Heap**: Escaping, large, or interface{} values
- ‚Üí **Use**: `go build -gcflags=-m` to see analysis

#### 4. GARBAGE COLLECTION:
- ‚Üí **Monitor**: GC frequency and pause times
- ‚Üí **Tune**: GOGC environment variable
- ‚Üí **Profile**: Use pprof for detailed analysis

## Real-World Impact

A simple for loop creating structs can cause:
- Heap thrashing
- Increased GC pauses  
- Higher memory usage
- Degraded response times

**Fixing allocation patterns can:**
- Drop GC pause times
- Cut memory usage
- Smooth out response times
- Improve overall performance

### Performance Benefits:
- **Reduced GC pressure and pause times**
- **Lower memory usage and allocations**
- **Improved application latency and throughput**  
- **Better resource utilization**

## Essential Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `go build -gcflags=-m` | See escape analysis |
| `GODEBUG=gctrace=1` | Monitor GC activity |
| `GOGC=50` | More frequent GC (less memory) |
| `GOGC=200` | Less frequent GC (more memory) |
| `go tool pprof` | Memory profiling |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Don't assume Go "just handles it"**
2. **Run `go build -gcflags=-m` to understand allocations**
3. **Use `sync.Pool` for frequently allocated objects**
4. **Monitor GC metrics in production**
5. **Profile memory usage with pprof**

Go gives you the tools. You just have to care enough to use them! üöÄ
